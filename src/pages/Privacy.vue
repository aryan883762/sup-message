          <hr>
          <p>
            sup("We") are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Please read below to see how sup handles information. Before you get to the details, here are a few of our fundamental privacy principles:
            sup relies on a number of legal bases to collect, use, share, and otherwise process the information we have about you for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill our obligations pursuant to the Terms of Use. For example, we cannot provide the Services unless we collect and use your personal information;</li>
            <li>where you have consented to the processing, which you can revoke at any time;</li>
            <li>where necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise and defend legal claims;</li>
            <li>where you have made the information public;</li>
            <li>where necessary in the public interest;</li>
            <li>where necessary for the purposes of sup’s or a third party’s legitimate interests, such as those of visitors, members or partners.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>We collect, Use and Otherwise Process Information</h4>
          <p>sup processes two broad categories of personal information when you use our products and services:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your personal information as a developer customer (or potential developer customer) of sup - information that we refer to as Customer Account Data.</li>
            <li>The personal information of your end users’ who use or interact with your application that you’ve built on sup’s platform - this category contains both your Customer Usage Data (e.g., communications metadata) and your Customer Content (e.g., the contents of communications).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>sup processes these categories of personal information differently because the direct relationship we have with you, our customer, is different than the indirect relationship we have with your end users.</p>
          <p>We, sup, collect and process your personal information:</p>
          <p>
            When you visit a sup public-facing website like sup.com, sign up for a sup event, like Signal, or make a request to receive information about sup or our products, like a sup whitepaper or a newsletter;
            When you contact sup’s Sales Team or Customer Support Team; and
            When you sign up for a sup account and use our products and services.
            We call this personal information Customer Account Data.
          </p>
          <p>Broadly speaking, we use Customer Account Data to further our legitimate interests to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>understand who our customers and potential customers are and their interests in sup’s product and services,</li>
            <li>manage our relationship with you and other customers,</li>
            <li>carry out core business operations such as accounting and filing taxes, and</li>
            <li>help detect, prevent, or investigate security incidents, fraud and other abuse and/or misuse of our products and services.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>How We Protect Information</h4>
          <small>
            The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
            <br>
            <br>
          </small>
          <small>
            All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. The Services uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information and credit card numbers.
            <br>
            <br>
          </small>
          <small>
            Where you have chosen a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. To achieve maximum data security, all Members’ passwords are encrypted.
            <br>
            <br>
          </small>
          <small>
            Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data (our secure servers use advanced firewall technology), we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Services; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
            <br>
            <br>
          </small>
          <small>
            To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing unauthorised access to your private information, you should be aware of the security features available to you through your browser. You should use a security-enabled browser to submit your credit card information and other personal information at the Services. Please note that if you do not use an SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having data intercepted.
            <br>
            <br>
          </small>
          <small>
            Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between secure and insecure communications, receive invalid services identification information for the Services you are communicating with, or send information over an unsecured connection. sup recommends that you enable these browser functions to help ensure that your communications are secure. You can also monitor the URL of the services you are visiting (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than http://), along with the security symbol of your browser to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server. You can also view the details of the security certificate of the services to which you are connected. Please check the validity of any Services you connect to using secure communications.

          <h4>How Long We Store Customers Account Data</h4>
          <p>sup will store your Customer Account Data as long as needed to provide you with our services and to operate our business. If you ask sup to delete specific personal information from your Customer Account Data (see ‘How To Make Choices About Your Customer Account Data’ below), we will honor this request unless deleting that information prevents us from carrying out necessary business functions, like billing for our services, calculating taxes, or conducting required audits.</p>
          <p>Here is an overview of how long we hold on to Customer Account Data in a form that can be used to identify you, unless there is a specific need or obligation to retain your information longer (like in the case of an open investigation, audit or other legal matter):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Customer Account Data stored in our customer relationship management system(s) is generally stored up to 7 years following closure of your account. Invoice records, including their digital equivalent, may be retained in identifying form by sup for longer periods for accounting, tax, and audit purposes depending on and in accordance with applicable tax law.</li>
            <li>Your communications with sup’s Customer Support Teams may be retained for up to 3 years after your account is closed.</li>
            <li>Apart from the above, within 60 days following closure of your account, we will either delete other Customer Account Data or transform it such that it can no longer be used to identify you.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>What Customer Usage Data and Customer Content sup Processes</h4>
          <p>
            We use Customer Usage Data and Customer Content to provide services to you and to carry out necessary functions of our business as a communications service provider. We do not sell your end users’ personal information and we do not share your end users’ information with third parties for those third parties’ own business interests.
            The particular end user personal information sup processes when you, our customer, use our products and services and the reason sup processes it depends on how you use our products and services and which sup products and services you use. For that reason, our API docs for each of our products and services are the best place to find information about our processing of personal information when you use that sup product and service.
          </p>
          <p>In many cases, you can opt to store records of your communications, or other activities, on sup, which may include your end users’ personal information. You may also have the option to use additional features or tools within sup’s products or services that allow you to do things such as analyze the records, including end user personal information, in your sup account. In those cases, sup will process this information to provide you with the service you request.</p>
          <p>In addition, records containing end user personal information may, from time to time, also be used in debugging or troubleshooting or in connection with investigations of security incidents, as well as for the purposes of detecting and preventing spam or fraudulent activity, and detecting and preventing network exploits and abuse.</p>
          <h4>How and When sup Use Information</h4>
          <p>We do not sell or allow your Customer Account Data to be used by third parties for their own marketing purposes, unless you ask us to do this or give us your consent to do this. Further, we do not sell your end users’ personal information (whether contained in Customer Usage Data or Customer Content). And, we do not share it with third parties for their own marketing or other purposes, unless you instruct us to do so.</p>
